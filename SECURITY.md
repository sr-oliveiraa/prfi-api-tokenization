## Reporting a Vulnerability

The PRFI Protocol team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@prfi-protocol.com**

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days.
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process.
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days.

### Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:
- Give us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue before public disclosure
- Avoid accessing, modifying, or deleting data that doesn't belong to you
- Don't perform actions that could harm the reliability or integrity of our services
- Don't access accounts or data that don't belong to you

## Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security

- **Audited Contracts**: All smart contracts undergo security audits before deployment
- **Multi-signature Wallets**: Critical operations require multiple signatures
- **Time Locks**: Important changes have mandatory waiting periods
- **Upgradeable Contracts**: Use proxy patterns for secure upgrades

### API Security

- **Authentication**: All API endpoints require proper authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DDoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications use TLS encryption

### Infrastructure Security

- **Environment Isolation**: Development, staging, and production are isolated
- **Secret Management**: Sensitive data is encrypted and stored securely
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege for all access
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring of all systems

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning of all code
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular updates and vulnerability checks
- **Code Reviews**: All changes require security-focused code review
- **Secure Defaults**: Security-first configuration by default

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Private Key Management

- **Never share** your private keys with anyone
- **Use hardware wallets** for significant amounts
- **Backup securely** using multiple secure locations
- **Use strong passwords** and enable 2FA where possible

### API Configuration

- **Use HTTPS** for all API endpoints
- **Implement rate limiting** on your APIs
- **Validate all inputs** before processing
- **Monitor for unusual activity** in your logs

### Environment Security

- **Keep dependencies updated** to latest secure versions
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Implement proper logging** without exposing sensitive data
- **Regular security audits** of your implementation

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment sent to reporter
3. **Day 3-7**: Initial assessment and triage
4. **Day 8-30**: Investigation and fix development
5. **Day 31**: Fix deployed and public disclosure (if appropriate)
