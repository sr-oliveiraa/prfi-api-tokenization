### Technical Specifications

#### Smart Contract
```solidity
contract PRFIC is ERC20, Ownable, Pausable, ReentrancyGuard {
    uint256 public constant MAX_SUPPLY = 122000000 * 10**18;
    uint256 public constant PREMINE_AMOUNT = 24400000 * 10**18;
    uint256 public constant EVENTS_PER_TOKEN = 1000;
    uint256 public constant MIN_BLOCK_DIFFICULTY = 4;
}
```
